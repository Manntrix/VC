Dairy Produce Packers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>â€‹</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This job was on the retail palletising line. Product is packs of cheese slices in box. Machine is a gantry robotic palletiser. There are 3 identical machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Controlsoft designed, programmed and installed a complete control solution. The PLC, I/O, drives and HMI were all replaced with the latest Allen Bradley hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The control software was rewritten from the ground up to comply with the latest standards. Recipes were created for each product and packing style. After simulation in the workshop, the system was installed and tested to ensure it performed exactly as required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allen Bradley hardware.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PLC :&nbsp;</strong>L30ERM</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I/O :</strong>&nbsp;Compact I/O</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Drives&nbsp;</strong>: Powerflex 527</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HMI :</strong>&nbsp;PanelView Plus 7</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Project Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The machines were built in 1997. The control hardware at 20 years of age was beginning to show signs of failure. The Human Machine Interface(HMI) was a Windows 95 device which was obsolete and uneconomical to maintain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system was becoming unreliable and unsafe, downtime was increasing and operators were being put at risk. Controlsoft were asked to supply a complete upgrade solution which could be adapted to the clients future products.</p>\n\n\n<p><!--EndFragment--></p>","date":"July 02, 2019","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized","slug":"uncategorized"}],"tags":[{"name":"ho","slug":"ho"}],"author":{"name":"Admin","slug":"admin"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0b193079-dbaa-5c1a-9d21-e090d5a86791"}}
